## Space Invaders

Space invaders is originally an arcade game released in 1978. It is a 2D shooter, the first of its genre. 
The goal, as for most of the arcade game of this time, is to obtain the highest score by destroying continuously the incoming aliens.

Here is two gifs of gameplay :

## Gameplay 

Many aliens are invading world and move slowly to you, shooting laser randomly in your direction.

The spaceship (aka the player) can move on the horizontal axis, avoiding laser shots. 
The spaceship can also fire at aliens, but it should aim properly since it's only one shot at a time.
It can take cover below barriers, but they are gradually destroyed by enemy lasers and spaceship missiles.

Hit aliens are destroyed and award points. Periodicaly, a mistery saucer will appear, granting a lot of bonus point if destroyed.
